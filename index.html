            down the seconds until midnight and exchanging hugs and well-wishes with friends and family. The new year is also a time
            for cultural traditions, such as eating lucky foods and wearing special clothes, to ensure a prosperous and fortunate
            year ahead. Whether you celebrate with a big gathering or quietly reflect on the year that has passed, the new year is a
